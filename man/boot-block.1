.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B boot-block
is a command that prompts Cobalt's system component to boot, free, or reboot a
a block on behalf of a user.  This can boot, free or reboot a block.  The command will complete after
the requested operation has completed.  To execute commands on a block, the user issuing the command
must be the user running the job, and must have that block, or a block with a superset of the resources
allocated to them through Cobalt.  Once the Cobalt resource allocation ends, all blocks booted by this
command on the allocated block will be freed.

.B \-\-block block-name

enviornment variable is checked and used as the block to boot.
.TP
.B \-\-jobid jobid
Boot a block for the specified jobid.  The executing user must be the owner of the
resource allocation in Cobalt, and the jobid must be running.  The environment variable
COBALT_JOBID is used if this option is not provided.
.TP
.B \-\-free
Free the specified block, and allow it's resources to be rebooted, or be rebooted as a part

to complete. This must not be used in conjunction with the
.BR \-\-reboot
flag.
.TP
.B \-\-reboot
Reboot the specified block.  This executes a free followed by a boot.  The block will be
ready to run jobs on completion.  Like the
.BR \-\-free
option the free stage will only
complete if all running jobs on the target block have been terminated.  This may not be used
with the
