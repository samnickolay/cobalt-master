# Command Line Options and Arguments to test qhold
# Special Instructions:
#    1. At the end of the arguments line need to supply test case comment as "# ... <tc:comment here with regex format '\w'>".
#    2. Test case comment needs to be unique to this file.
#    3. Before putting the test case comment you need to put the comment character '#'
#    4. You can add comments by putting the '#' character before any comment.
#    5. If you only want a new command to be executed then put the tag <NEW_ONLY> after the comment character '#'
#    6. If the old command and new command have different args for the same effect then
#       put the old args first then use the separate character '|' and put the new args.
#       i.e -d -j | -d --job
